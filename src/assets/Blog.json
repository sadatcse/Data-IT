    "full_article": "MERN Stack is one of the most popular technologies used to build modern web applications. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. These four technologies work together to create fast, flexible, and scalable applications.\n\nOne of the biggest advantages of MERN Stack is that it uses JavaScript for both frontend and backend development. This makes development faster and easier because developers do not need to learn multiple programming languages. It also reduces development cost for businesses.\n\nMongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible format. This makes it easy to manage large amounts of data and scale applications as the business grows. Express.js is a backend framework that helps manage APIs and server-side logic efficiently.\n\nReact.js is used for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable components, which improves performance and user experience. React applications are fast and responsive, making them ideal for modern users.\n\nNode.js handles server-side operations and supports high traffic. It allows applications to handle many users at the same time without slowing down.\n\nBusinesses choose MERN Stack because it supports rapid development, easy maintenance, and long-term scalability. At Data IT, we use MERN Stack to build secure and modern web solutions that help businesses grow faster."
